# Alastria Besu Regular Node

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository is based on the [Alastria Node Besu](https://github.com/alastria/alastria-node-besu) repository. This repository contains code and documentations needed to deploy private besu node on Alastria Network B.

## Prerequisites

You need to install Docker and Docker Compose. I have put the [installation guidelines](requirements.md) to make it easy for you.

## Deployment

1. Clone the repository.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/b-rohit/alastria-regular-node-besu.git
   ```
2. Generate private and public for besu node

   ```
   cd alastria-regular-node-besu
   ./node.sh key
   ```

   This is one time operation. The aforementioned command will run a docker container with [hyperledger/besu](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/besu) image and generate keys in key folder in the current directory. Keep your private key safe, do not reveal it.

3. Launch Node
   ```
   ./node.sh up
   ```
   The command will spin up 3 docker containers namely besu, prometheus, and explorer. The besu container is the most important of all as it is your regular besu node. The [config.toml](config/besu/config.toml) and [genesis.json](config/besu/genesis.json) files are used to configure the besu node. You can make changes in the config.toml file to change the behavior of the node. You donâ€™t need to touch the genesis.json file. The command will give output similar to following
   ```
   Starting besu       ... done
   Starting prometheus ... done
   Starting explorer   ... done
      Name                 Command               State                                                          Ports

   Prometheus address                  : http://127.0.0.1:9090/graph
   ```

## Registration

After successful deployment, you need to register the node to access the Alastria Network B because it is a private permissioned blockchain network. The steps are following:

1. Get your enode
   ```
   curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_enode","params":[],"id":1}' http://127.0.0.1:8545
   ```
2. Fill in the [electronic form](https://portal.r2docuo.com/alastria/forms/noderequest) and submit.

## Systemd Service

Although it is an optional step, it is quite useful to manage your docker containers using a service. The service will stop the containers during system shutdown and start them again automatically on system startup without loosing container data. The steps to configure the service are following:

1. Set the repo path in the besu-node.service and copy it to /etc/systemd/system
   ```
   sudo cp service/besu-node.service /etc/systemd/system
   ```
2. Enable the service

   ```
   sudo systemctl enable besu-node
   ```

This is all. It will enable the service to manage the containers at system reboot. You can start, stop, and check status of the service using following commands.

```
sudo systemctl start besu-node
sudo systemctl stop besu-node
sudo systemctl status besu-node
```

## Usage

You can interact with the besu node using [HTTP JSON RPC requests](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/) on port 8545. The Prometheus and Block Explorer dashboards can be accessed on http://127.0.0.1:9090 and http://127.0.0.1:8080 respectively.
